        <h1>Introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks, 
                pitting one against the other (thus the “adversarial”) in order to generate new, synthetic instances of data that can pass for real data. 
                They are used widely in image generation, video generation and voice generation.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Generative vs. Discriminative Algorithms</h2>
            <p>
                To understand GANs, you should know how generative algorithms work, and for that, contrasting them with discriminative algorithms is instructive. 
                Discriminative algorithms try to classify input data; that is, given the features of an instance of data, they predict a label or category to which that data belongs.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, given all the words in an email (the data instance), a discriminative algorithm could predict whether the message is spam or not_spam. spam is one of the labels, 
                and the bag of words gathered from the email are the features that constitute the input data. When this problem is expressed mathematically, the label is called y and the features are called x. 
                The formulation p(y|x) is used to mean “the probability of y given x”, which in this case would translate to “the probability that an email is spam given the words it contains.”
            </p>
            <p>
                So discriminative algorithms map features to labels. 
                They are concerned solely with that correlation. 
                One way to think about generative algorithms is that they do the opposite. 
                Instead of predicting a label given certain features, they attempt to predict features given a certain label.
            </p>
            <p>
                The question a generative algorithm tries to answer is: Assuming this email is spam, how likely are these features? While discriminative models care about the relation between y and x, generative models care about “how you get x.” 
                They allow you to capture p(x|y), the probability of x given y, or the probability of features given a label or category. 
                (That said, generative algorithms can also be used as classifiers. It just so happens that they can do more than categorize input data.)
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>How GANs Work</h2>
            <p>
                One neural network, called the generator, generates new data instances, while the other, the discriminator, evaluates them for authenticity; i.e. the discriminator decides whether each instance of data that it reviews belongs to the actual training dataset or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of the discriminator, when shown an instance from the true dataset, is to recognize those that are authentic.
                Meanwhile, the generator is creating new, synthetic images that it passes to the discriminator. 
                It does so in the hopes that they, too, will be deemed authentic, even though they are fake. 
                The goal of the generator is to generate passable images: to lie without being caught. 
                The goal of the discriminator is to identify images coming from the generator as fake.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="../assets/networks/gan.png" class="center">
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are the steps a GAN takes:
                <ul class = "listobject">
                    <li>
                        The generator takes in random numbers and returns an image.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This generated image is fed into the discriminator alongside a stream of images taken from the actual, ground-truth dataset.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The discriminator takes in both real and fake images and returns probabilities, a number between 0 and 1, with 1 representing a prediction of authenticity and 0 representing fake.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                So you have a double feedback loop:
                
                <ul class = "listobject">
                    <li>
                        The discriminator is in a feedback loop with the ground truth of the images, which we know.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The generator is in a feedback loop with the discriminator.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>The Discriminator</h2>
            <p>
                The discriminator in a GAN is simply a classifier. 
                It tries to distinguish real data from the data created by the generator. 
                It could use any network architecture appropriate to the type of data it's classifying.
                <img src="../assets/networks/disc.svg">
            </p>
            <h3>Discriminator Training Data</h3>
            <p>
                The discriminator's training data comes from two sources:
                <ul class="listobject">
                    <li>
                        <b>Real data</b> instances, such as real pictures of people. 
                        The discriminator uses these instances as positive examples during training.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Fake data</b> instances created by the generator. 
                        The discriminator uses these instances as negative examples during training.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In Figure, the two "Sample" boxes represent these two data sources feeding into the discriminator. 
                During discriminator training the generator does not train. 
                Its weights remain constant while it produces examples for the discriminator to train on.
            </p>
            <h3>Training the Discriminator</h3>
            <p>
                The discriminator connects to two loss functions. 
                During discriminator training, the discriminator ignores the generator loss and just uses the discriminator loss. 
                We use the generator loss during generator 
                During the discriminator training: 
                <ol class="listobject">
                    <li>
                        The discriminator classifies both real data and fake data from the generator.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The discriminator loss penalizes the discriminator for misclassifying a real instance as fake or a fake instance as real.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The discriminator updates its weights through backpropagation from the discriminator loss through the discriminator network.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>The Generator</h2>
            <p>
                The generator part of a GAN learns to create fake data by incorporating feedback from the discriminator. 
                It learns to make the discriminator classify its output as real.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generator training requires tighter integration between the generator and the discriminator than discriminator training requires. 
                The portion of the GAN that trains the generator includes:
                <ul class="listobject">
                    <li>random noise input</li>
                    <li>generator network, which transforms the random input into a data instance</li>
                    <li>discriminator network, which classifies the generated data</li>
                    <li>discriminator output</li>
                    <li>generator loss, which penalizes the generator for failing to fool the discriminator</li>
                </ul>
